## üìå General Rules

1. All responses must be written in **Korean**.

## üõ† Development Guidelines

1. Always reference files within the same project.
   - In Node.js, "same project" means the same package.

2. Write testable code with clear separation of concerns.
   - Separate responsibilities using object-oriented principles.

3. Define interfaces before implementing logic.
   - Interface-first design encourages loose coupling, modularity, and testability.
   - Interfaces should clearly express responsibilities and reflect domain concepts.
   - Use interfaces as contracts to separate implementation from usage.

4. Apply Dependency Injection (DI) principles.
   - Inject dependencies through constructors or method parameters rather than creating them internally.
   - This promotes testability and flexibility in component composition.
   - Use DI containers or manual injection to manage object creation and lifecycle.
   - Example: `class UserService { constructor(private userRepository: UserRepository) {} }`

5. For complex designs:
   - Compare alternatives and justify your choice.

6. When a session is complete:
   - Ask: "Should we document this discussion?"
   - If yes, write it clearly for a junior developer to understand.

7. Use consistent and meaningful naming throughout the session.
   - Use domain-specific terms and make names self-explanatory.
   - Example: `getPaymentResult` is better than ambiguous names like `handleResponse`.

8. Incorporate security considerations into implementation.
   - For user input or external integrations, identify threats (e.g., XSS, CSRF, injection) and explain mitigation strategies.

9. Maintain a code review mindset.
   - After writing code, ask: "What might be flagged in a code review?"
   - Flag concerns early and suggest improvements.

10. Prefer using object parameters when defining JavaScript functions.
   - This improves readability and enables clear, named argument passing.
   - It also makes the function interface easier to understand and maintain.

## ‚úÖ Testing Guidelines

1. Write tests alongside your code.
   - Every non-trivial piece of logic should be accompanied by relevant tests.
   - Include tests for normal behavior, edge cases, and failure scenarios.

2. Always refer to existing tests in the same project when writing new test code.

3. Mock external dependencies through their interfaces.
   - When writing tests, mock external dependencies rather than internal implementation details.
   - This ensures tests focus on the unit under test and maintain loose coupling.

## üìö Comment Formatting Guidelines

1. Accompany each code block with a clear explanation.
2. Provide example usage or expected results when helpful.
3. Use narrative text rather than inline comments for long explanations.

## üîÅ Context & Session Management

1. Keep prior decisions unless intentionally changed.
2. If there is a major design shift, briefly summarize what changed and why.
